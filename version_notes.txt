Version DCCD-1.0

Source files reorganization.

Added modules:
	cli - command line interface. It helps you to generate private keys,
		produce manipulations with these keys, make and broadcast transactions.

	crypto - my realization of some cryptofunctions. Like generation of random
		private key, transforming of it to the WIF format and back, digital
		signature for messages and verifying of it using different libs.

	node_config - configurations accordance to the current node: path
		config, friendly nodes and private key for mining.
		This directoryhasn't source control (added to .gitignore)

	node_tmp - store files with temporary data (like mempool or blocks).
		In fututre, this information should to store in special database,
		unique to each node.

	objects - main objects of the project. Like transactions, block,
		blockchain, etc.

	staff - staff functions, like colorful output of the text, nothing special.

	templates - flask's whim, storage of index.html. API usage output.

	tests - for now only de-/serialization testing and transaction to dict
		and from dict functions. More tests in future!

	validators - transaction and blocks validator functions. In future, maybe
		validator of other chain and other node :)

	wrapers - very imortant systems wrapers. Like file systems wraper or api wraper.
